# xss-common-payloads
These are some of the most common xss (Cross-Site-Scripting) payloads that work.
Xss or Cross-Site-Scripting is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to compromise the interactions that users have with a vulnerable application. It allows an attacker to circumvent the same origin policy, which is designed to segregate different websites from each other.Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities normally allow an attacker to masquerade as a victim user, to carry out any actions that the user is able to perform, and to access any of the user's data.
